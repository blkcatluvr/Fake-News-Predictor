- source_sentence: for six day begin on oct . 21 visitor to the crenelated fortresslike
    park avenue armory will find its interior transform into a light modern setting
    . translucent scrim will obscure the lobby and period room which will open to
    the public for the first time since their recent restoration . mute color will
    turn the drill room into airy gallery . there s a message in this metamorphosis
    which be commission for the american debut of the european fine art fair know
    as tefaf . with its careful vetting of object on display date from antiquity to
    the present the fair be consider the most prestigious art bazaar in the world
    . tefafs arrival in manhattan from its home in maastricht the netherlands be more
    than just another event on the cultural calendar . its an attempt by the fair
    whose 270 exhibitor face a shrink audience in europe to secure and revitalize
    its future . its a chance for dealer in historical art tefafs forte to staunch
    the stampede of collector into contemporary art and show that work of old art
    can look just as good in a modern setting as in a grand classical home . and its
    a test of the global art market which shrink to 63 . 8 billion in 2015 a 7 percent
    drop from 2014 and continue to wobble judge by auction result this year . many
    more people need to know what we be do say patrick van maris the fair chief executive
    . but can maastricht convert manhattan ? the people mr . van maris refer to be
    mostly americans who buy more art than any other nationality but constitute only
    2 000 to 2 500 of the 75 000 people who visit tefaf maastricht a number that may
    dwindle far in an age of terrorism fear . some longstanding exhibitor like otto
    naumann a new york dealer in old master be debate whether to continue show at
    maastricht at all . after year of pressure from exhibitor tefaf last winter agree
    to collaborate with artvest partner a new york advisory firm on a split spectacle
    a fall event for art through the 1920 and a second fair in may for modern and
    contemporary art and design . mr . van maris dismiss the idea that a soft market
    be not the time to establish a new outpost . marc porter the former chairman of
    christies america who be soon to take a high post at sothebys also play down the
    market gamble . you can not time the market he say . you enter when the space
    and calendar become available and you have a critical mass of dealer . but tefaf
    new york fall which hope to attract 22 000 visitor be still a risky bet accord
    to jonathan t. d. neil director of sothebys institute of angeles . there s so
    much that happen in new york already he say . people have access to a lot of this
    material on a nonstop basis . new york in other word be the opposite of maastricht
    and that may not be good . maastricht be a great fair because people go for a
    few day and there be nothing else to do except restaurant say george wachter chairman
    of sothebys north america and south america . they go with buying in mind . for
    the new york fair from perhaps 300 applicant tefaf decline to provide the exact
    number a committee select 94 dealer from 13 country with reputation for show art
    that be fresh to the market . they will be offer not just old master painting
    and sculpture for which maastricht be fame but also jewelry antiquity book and
    manuscript american painting and decorative art drawing european furniture and
    african oceanic islamic and asian art . about 20 dealer from buenos aire to the
    hague to paris have never exhibit in new york or at least not in year . but maastricht
    location be only one of tefafs challenge . there be also fair fatigue . in 2015
    collector could choose from 269 art fair around the world up from 105 in 2005
    accord to the art newspaper . the rotation of taste toward postwar and contemporary
    art have also hurt . fair like art basel in switzerland the premier contemporary
    fair which regularly attract 90 000 visitor clearly help enlarge the pool of collector
    . tefaf new york want to show americans that a vast area of material which they
    have really only see in museum and a few gallery here can be theirs say france
    beatty president of the new york dealer richard l. feigen company who will be
    exhibit in october . and visitor may find price point that be not available in
    art say michael plummer a partner in artvest . you can get master work for less
    money . some buyer may come from an emerge group call who buy in more than one
    category start say in contemporary and then add traditional art . I see more and
    more collector go in both direction say marc spiegler global director of art basel
    . the challenge be to enlarge that group . with tefaf in new york other be capitalize
    on the moment . christie which have already create themed sale week and auction
    that mix collect category have move up its sale of old master and art to oct .
    26 . fifteen upper east side dealer have organize october art week begin with
    evening reception on oct . 20 . many thing could go wrong for tefaf . for one
    there be less than a week available to transform the armory then set up and vet
    the offering . the fair may not attract attendee who buy enough to offset the
    high cost in new york compare with maastricht . the average cost of a tefaf booth
    in new york be 38 500 more than twice that in maastricht . add to that introduction
    fee setup and decorate cost dealer do the interior of their booth shipping expense
    and money spend on staffing and travel . the total can run 100 000 to 250 000
    per exhibitor dealer say . some dealer do not seem worried . the business go the
    whole year round say jorge coll a partner at colnaghi a dealer with gallery in
    london and madrid . you may start thing in europe and finish they in the u. s.
    or vice versa . mr . van maris too be take a long view . our audience say you
    have to be here . let I tell you in a few year whether we ve succeed .

  - scholar and journalist heather mac donald toil away early on in her career at
    liberal enclave but through her streetlevel reporting on social service and the
    police her worldview shift away from liberalprogressive to conservative.her shift
    be not some kind of epiphany from read conservative principle but by hear the
    voice of welfare recipient who tell her government aid become a narcotic . her
    late book the war on cop be now available for purchase . in her book she outline
    the false narrative that be be push by black life matter and the leftist medium
    that law enforcement officer be out to get black in america.for almost two year
    a protest movement know as black life matter have convulse the nation . trigger
    by the police shooting of michael brown in ferguson missouri in august 2014 the
    black life matter movement hold that racist police officer be the great threat
    face young black man today . this belief have trigger riot diein the murder and
    attempt murder of police officer a campaign to eliminate traditional grand jury
    proceeding when police use lethal force and a presidential task force on policing.even
    though the u.s . justice department have resoundingly disproven the lie that a
    pacific michael brown be shoot in cold blood while try to surrender brown be still
    venerate as a martyr . and now police officer be back off of proactive policing
    in the face of the relentless venom direct at they on the street and in the medium
    . as a result violent crime be on the rise.the need be urgent therefore to examine
    the black life matter movement s central thesis that police pose the great threat
    to young black man . I propose two counter hypothesis first that there be no government
    agency more dedicated to the idea that black life matter than the police and second
    that we have be talk obsessively about allege police racism over the last 20 year
    in order to avoid talk about a far large problem blackonblack crime.let s be clear
    at the outset police have an indefeasible obligation to treat everyone with courtesy
    and respect and to act within the confine of the law . too often officer develop
    a harden obnoxious attitude . it be also true that be stop when you be innocent
    of any wrongdoing be infuriate humiliating and sometimes terrify . and needless
    to say every unjustified police shooting of an unarmed civilian be a stomachchurning
    tragedy.given the history of racism in this country and the complicity of the
    police in that history police shooting of black man be particularly and understandably
    fraught . that history inform how many people view the police . but however intolerable
    and inexcusable every act of police brutality be and while we need to make sure
    that the police be properly train in the constitution and in courtesy there be
    a large reality behind the issue of police crime and race that remain a taboo
    topic . the problem of blackonblack crime be an uncomfortable truth but unless
    we acknowledge it we win t get very far in understand pattern of policing . imprimushere
    be 5 indisputable fact that prove this narrative to be one big lie1 . cop kill
    nearly twice as many white as black in 2015 . accord to datum compile by the washington
    post 50 percent of the victim of fatal police shooting be white while 26 percent
    be black . the majority of these victim have a gun or be armed or otherwise threaten
    the officer with potentially lethal force accord to mac donald in a speech at
    hillsdale college.some may argue that these statistic be evidence of racist treatment
    toward black since white consist of 62 percent of the population and black make
    up 13 percent of the population . but as mac donald write in the wall street journal
    2009 statistic from the bureau of justice statistic reveal that black be charge
    with 62 percent of robbery 57 percent of murder and 45 percent of assault in the
    75 big county in the country despite only comprise roughly 15 percent of the population
    in these county . such a concentration of criminal violence in minority community
    mean that officer will be disproportionately confront armed and often resist suspect
    in those community raise officer own risk of use lethal force write macdonald.2
    . more white and hispanic die from police homicide than black . accord to mac
    donald 12 percent of white and hispanic homicide death be due to police officer
    while only four percent of black homicide death be the result of police officer
    . if we re go to have a life matter antipolice movement it would be more appropriately
    name white and hispanic life matter say mac donald in her hillsdale speech.3 .
    the post s data do show that unarmed black man be more likely to die by the gun
    of a cop than an unarmed white man but this do not tell the whole story . in august
    2015 the ratio be seventoone of unarmed black man die from police gunshot compare
    to unarmed white man the ratio be sixtoone by the end of 2015 . but mac donald
    point out in the marshall project that look at the detail of the actual incident
    that occur paint a different picturethe unarmed label be literally accurate but
    it frequently fail to convey highlycharged policing situation . in a number of
    case if the victim end up be unarmed it be certainly not for lack of try . at
    least five black victim have reportedly try to grab the officer s gun or have
    be beat the cop with his own equipment . some be shoot from an accidental discharge
    trigger by their own assault on the officer . and two individual include in the
    post s unarmed black victim category be strike by stray bullet aim at someone
    else in justify cop shooting . if the victim be not the intended target then racism
    could have play no role in their deaths.in one of those unintended case an undercover
    cop from the new york police department be conduct a gun sting in mount vernon
    just north of new york city . one of the gun trafficker jump into the cop s car
    stick a pistol to his head grab 2400 and flee . the officer give chase and open
    fire after the thief again point his gun at he . two of the officer s bullet accidentally
    hit a 61yearold bystander kill he . that old man happen to be black but his race
    have nothing to do with his tragic death . in the other collateral damage case
    virginia beach virginia officer approach a car park at a convenience store that
    have a homicide suspect in the passenger seat . the suspect open fire send a bullet
    through an officer s shirt . the cop return fire kill their assailant as well
    as a woman in the driver s seat . that woman enter the post s database without
    qualification as an unarmed black victim of police fire.mac donald examine a number
    of other instance include unarmed black man in san diego ca and prince george
    s county md attempt to reach for a gun in a police officer s holster . in the
    san diego case the unarmed black man actually jump the officer and assault he
    and the cop shoot the man since he be fear for his life . macdonald also note
    that there be an instance in 2015 where three officer be kill with their own gun
    which the suspect have wrestle from they . 4 . black and hispanic police officer
    be more likely to fire a gun at black than white officer . this be accord to a
    department of justice report in 2015 about the philadelphia police department
    and be far confirm that by a study conduct university of pennsylvania criminologist
    greg ridgeway in 2015 that determine black cop be 3.3 time more likely to fire
    a gun than other cop at a crime scene.5 . black be more likely to kill cop than
    be kill by cop . this be accord to fbi datum which also find that 40 percent of
    cop killer be black . accord to mac donald the police officer be 18.5 time more
    likely to be kill by a black than a cop kill an unarmed black person.despite the
    fact the antipolice rhetoric of black life matter and their leftist sympathizer
    have result in what mac donald call the ferguson effect as murder have spike by
    17 percent among the 50 big city in the u.s . as a result of cop be more reluctant
    to police neighborhood out of fear of be label as racist . additionally there
    have be over twice as many cop victimize by fatal shooting in the first three
